# Description

A toy regular expression engine implementation for exploring the differences between backtracking vs finite automata
algorithms.

## TODO

- [ ] Check regex syntax errors
- [ ] Export NFA as Graphviz DOT file
- [ ] Support NFA to DFA conversion
- [ ] Print AST
- [ ] Display NFA states in table format
- [ ] NFA/DFA minimization
- [ ] Support POSIX basic regular expression syntax
